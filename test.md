# testing


tests are created as basic source files
they can be c, c++, or assembly

for each there is a default way to run them
otherwise a run file can be supplied that customizes it

for each there is an exp file that specifies the expected stdout


you can also specifc a state file that after the run examines the state of the machine



test all available toolchains, or just the ones specified by the tool


improve to kick back results as they become available, use yield
